- The first part `a beautiful painting about a x` will be the focus of the image, whatever you describe there, will be the main thing in the image, in foreground-mid ground, 

-  the second part `surrounded by y` will be the background (secondary important). 

- the third part `stormy clouds and rain` is setting up the weight, apparently.
